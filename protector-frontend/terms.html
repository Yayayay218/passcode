                    <p>Please read this Terms of Service agreement (the “Terms”) carefully. By accessing or using this

                        (the “Website”) in any way, including using the services and resources available or enabled via
                        the
                        Website or application (the “Service”), downloading the Photohub software application for
                        mobile
                        devices (the “Application”), completing the registration process, and/or merely browsing the
                        Website,
                        you represent that (1) you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by the Terms, (2) you
                        are of
                        legal age to form a binding contract with Photohub, and (3) you have the authority to enter
                        into
                        the
                        Terms personally or on behalf of the company you have named as the customer, and to bind that
                        company to
                        the Terms. The term “you” refers to the individual or legal entity, as applicable, identified as
                        the
                        customer when you registered on the Website. If you do not agree to be bound by the terms, you
                        may
                        not
                        access or use this Website or the Service.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you subscribe to the Services for a term (the “Initial Term”), then the Terms will be
                        automatically
                        renewed for additional periods of the same duration as the initial term at Photohub’s

                    <p>
                        The terms of use require the the use of arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes,
                        rather
                        than jury trials or class actions, and also limit the remedies available to you in the event of
                        a
                        dispute.

                        time. We
                        will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of the Terms. If we make any material changes,
                        and

                        have registered to use the Service, we will also send an e-mail to you at the last e-mail

                        after

                        shall

                        constitutes your acceptance of such change(s). <b> PLEASE REGULARLY CHECK THE WEBSITE TO VIEW

                            within and paid by you under the Terms shall be considered solely in furtherance of this
                            purpose. In no way are these fees paid considered payment for the sale, license, or use of
                            Photohub’s Software or Application, and, furthermore, any use of Photohub's Software or

                            purpose of the Terms.</p>
                        <b>Payment</b>
                        <p>You agree to pay all fees or charges to your Account in accordance with the fees, charges,
                            and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable. Photohub
                            collects payments through a limited number of payment services (“Payment Provider”). You
                            must provide Photohub with valid account information for the respective chosen Payment
                            Provider. Your Payment Provider agreement governs your use of the designated credit card or
                            other payment method, and you must refer to that agreement and not the Terms to determine
                            your rights and liabilities. By providing Photohub with your payment information, you agree

                            due and payable to Photohub hereunder and that no additional notice or consent is required.

                            Subscription Fee”) at the time you create your Account and select the term of your
                            subscription (each, a “Service Commencement Date”). Except as set forth in the Terms, all
                            fees for the Services are non-refundable. No contract will exist between you and Photohub
                            for the Services until Photohub or the Payment Provider, for example Apple or Google,
                            accepts your order by a confirmatory e-mail, SMS/MMS message, or other appropriate means of
                            communication.</p>
                        <b>Taxes</b>
                        <p>Photohub’s fees are net of any applicable Sales Tax. If any Service, or payments for any
                            Service, are subject to Sales Tax in any jurisdiction and you have not remitted the
                            applicable Sales Tax to Photohub, you will be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax
                            and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority and you will indemnify
                            Photohub for any liability or expense we may incur in connection with such Sales Taxes.
                            Upon our request, you will provide us with official receipts issued by the appropriate
                            taxing authority, or such other evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes. For
                            purposes of this section, “Sales Tax” shall mean any sales or use tax, and any other tax
                            measured by sales proceeds, that Photohub its permitted to pass to its customers that is
                            the functional equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not
                            otherwise impose a sales or use tax.</p>
                        <b>Automatic Renewal</b>
                        <p>Your subscription will continue indefinitely until terminated in accordance with the Terms.
                            After your initial subscription period, and again after any subsequent subscription period,
                            your subscription will automatically commence on the first day following the end of such
                            period (each a “Renewal Commencement Date”) and continue for an additional equivalent
                            period, at Photohub's then-current price for such subscription. You agree that your Account
                            will be subject to this automatic renewal feature unless you cancel your subscription at
                            least 24 hours prior to the Renewal Commencement Date by logging into and going to the
                            "Manage App Subscriptions” page in the Apple App Store or the “My Apps” page in the Google
                            Play Store app. The same page will permit you to change your Account settings if you do not
                            wish your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your
                            subscription. If you cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end
                            of your then-current subscription term; your subscription will not be renewed after your
                            then-current term expires. However, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any
                            portion of the subscription fee paid for the then- current subscription period. By
                            subscribing, you authorize Photohub to charge your Payment Provider now, and again at the
                            beginning of any subsequent subscription period. Upon renewal of your subscription, if
                            Photohub does not receive payment from your Payment Provider, (i) you agree to pay all
                            amounts due on your Account upon demand, and/or (ii) you agree that Photohub may either
                            terminate or suspend your subscription and continue to attempt to charge your Payment
                            Provider until payment is received (upon receipt of payment, your Account will be
                            re-activated and for purposes of automatic renewal, your new subscription commitment period
                            will begin as of the day payment was received).</p>

                        <p>If your registration(s) with or ability to access the Photohub Properties is discontinued by
                            Photohub due to your violation of any portion of the Terms, then you agree that you shall

                            hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states, “A general release does not
                            extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the
                            time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his

                            will be null and void.</p>

                            terrorism; riots; embargos; acts of civil or military authorities; fire; floods; accidents;

                        <b>Dispute Resolution</b>
                        <p>(a) Any claim or dispute (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set
                            forth below) in connection with the Terms where the total amount of the award sought is less
                            than Five Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $5,000.00) may be resolved in a cost effective manner
                            through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief.
                            Such arbitration shall be initiated through an established alternative dispute resolution
                            provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section and under the
                            rules of such ADR Provider, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms.
                            The party demanding arbitration will propose an ADR Provider and the other party shall not
                            unreasonably withhold consent to use such ADR Provider. The ADR Provider and the parties
                            must comply with the following rules:</p>
                        <p>(1) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written
                            submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the
                            arbitration;</p>
                        <p>(2) all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English;</p>
                        <p>(3) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses
                            unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties;</p>
                        <p>(4) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of
                            competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney fees) and
                            disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of the fees and
                            costs of the ADR Provider. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Photohub may seek injunctive or
                            other equitable relief to protect its intellectual property rights in any court of competent
                            jurisdiction. Please note that the laws of the jurisdiction where you are located may be
                            different from California law, including the laws governing what can legally be sold,
                            bought, exported, offered or imported. You shall always comply with all the international
                            and domestic laws, ordinances, regulations and statutes that are applicable to your use of
                            the Photohub Properties.</p>
                        <p>(b) Any other dispute (including whether the claims asserted are arbitrable) shall be
                            referred to and finally determined by binding and confidential arbitration. Arbitration
                            shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law. The
                            arbitration shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience
                            in resolving commercial contract disputes from the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”).
                            As modified by the Terms, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the
                            arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the
                            arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes
                            (collectively “Rules and Procedures”).</p>
                        <p>(c) You are thus GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights EXCEPT
                            for matters that may be taken to small claims court. Your rights will be determined by a
                            NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. You are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the
                            arbitration procedures are SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT.
                            Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED
                            REVIEW BY A COURT.</p>
                        <p>(d) You and Photohub must abide by the following rules:</p>
                        <p>(i) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR Photohub MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL
                            CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
                            PROCEEDING;</p>
                        <p>(ii) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE
                            PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE
                            RELIEF;</p>
                        <p>(iii) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be
                            prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, Photohub will pay as much of your filing
                            and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to
                            prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of
                            litigation;</p>
                        <p>(iv) Photohub also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume
                            responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration;</p>
                        <p>(v) the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law;</p>
                        <p>(vi) the arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the
                            existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for
                            the purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award;</p>
                        <p>(vii) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are
                            permitted by applicable law;</p>
                        <p>(viii) each side pays its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a statutory
                            provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses,
                            and then in such instance, the fees and costs awarded shall be determined by applicable
                            law.</p>
                        <p>(e) The arbitral proceedings, and all pleadings and written evidence will be in the English
                            language. Any written evidence originally in a language other than English will be submitted
                            in English translation accompanied by the original or true copy thereof. The English
                            language version will control. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of
                            decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based,
                            including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator will not have authority to
                            award damages in excess of the amount, or other than the types, allowed by Section 8 of the
                            Terms. Judgment on the award of the arbitrator may be entered by any court of competent
                            jurisdiction. The arbitrator also shall be authorized to grant any temporary, preliminary or
                            permanent equitable remedy or relief it deems just and equitable and within the scope of the
                            Terms, including, without limitation, an injunction or order for specific performance. The
                            arbitration award shall be final and binding upon the parties without appeal or review
                            except as permitted by California law or United States federal law.</p>
                        <p>- Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Photohub may bring an individual action in
                            small claims court. Further, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse
                            Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark,
                            or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration agreement. Such claims shall be
                            exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located in San Francisco County,
                            California. Additionally, notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek
                            emergency equitable relief before the state or federal courts located in San Francisco
                            County, California, in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and hereby
                            agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San
                            Francisco County, California for such purpose. A request for interim measures shall not be
                            deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.</p>
                        <p>(f) With the exception of (d)(i) and (ii) above (prohibiting arbitration on a class or
                            collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid,
                            unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the
                            balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in
                            accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision
                            were not contained herein. If, however, either (d)(i) or (ii) is found to be invalid,
                            unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and
                            void, and neither you nor Photohub shall be entitled to arbitration. If for any reason, a
                            claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute shall be exclusively brought
                            in state or federal court in San Francisco County, California. By using the Photohub
                            Properties in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration provision.

                        <b>Choice of Law and Venue</b>
                        <p>The Terms and any action related thereto will be governed and interpreted by and under the
                            laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles
                            that require the application of the law of a different state. You hereby expressly consent
                            to the personal jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts for the county in
                            which Photohub’s principal place of business is located for any lawsuit filed against you
                            by Photohub arising from or related to the Terms.</p>
                        <b>Notice</b>
                        <p>Where Photohub requires that you provide an e-mail address, you are responsible for
                            providing Photohub with your most current e-mail address. In the event that the last e-mail
                            address you provided to Photohub is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of
                            delivering to you any notices required/permitted by the Terms, Photohub’s dispatch of the
                            e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice. You may give
                            notice to Photohub at the following address: 178 Castro St., San Francisco, CA 94114. Such
                            notice shall be deemed given when received by Photohub by letter delivered by nationally
                            recognized overnight delivery service or first class postage prepaid mail at the above
                            address.</p>
                        <b>Waiver</b>
                        <p>Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of the Terms on one occasion will not be
                            deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.</p>
                        <b>Severability</b>
                        <p>If any provision of the Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the
                            other provisions of the Terms will remain enforceable, and the invalid or unenforceable
                            provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent
                            permitted by law.</p>
                        <b>App Stores</b>
                        <p>You acknowledge and agree that the availability of the Application and the Services is
                            dependent on the third party from whom you received the Application license, e.g., the Apple

                            between you and Photohub only, and not with the App Store. Photohub, not the App Store, is
                            solely responsible for the Photohub Properties, including the Application, the contents

                            from the Apple App Store:</p>
                        <p>(a) You acknowledge and agree that (i) the Terms are concluded between you and Photohub
                            only, and not Apple, and (ii) Photohub, not Apple, is solely responsible for the App Store
                            Sourced Application and content thereof. Your use of the App Store Sourced Application must

                        <p>(b) You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and

                            applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the
                            App Store Sourced Application to you and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,
                            Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App Store
                            Sourced Application. As between Photohub and Apple, any other claims, losses, liabilities,

                            the sole responsibility of Photohub.</p>
                        <p>(d) You and Photohub acknowledge that, as between Photohub and Apple, Apple is not
                            responsible for addressing any claims you have or any claims of any third party relating to
                            the App Store Sourced Application or your possession and use of the App Store Sourced
                            Application, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim
                            that the App Store Sourced Application fails to conform to any applicable legal or

                            legislation.</p>
                        <p>(e) You and Photohub acknowledge that, in the event of any third party claim that the App

                            infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, as between Photohub and Apple,
                            Photohub, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement
                            and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by
                            the Terms.</p>
                        <p>(f) You and Photohub acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third
                            party beneficiaries of the Terms as related to your license of the App Store Sourced
                            Application, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the Terms, Apple
                            will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce the Terms as
                            related to your license of the App Store Sourced Application against you as a third party
                            beneficiary thereof.</p>
                        <p>(g) Without limiting any other terms of the Terms, you must comply with all applicable third
                            party terms of agreement when using the App Store Sourced Application.</p>
